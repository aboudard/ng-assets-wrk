# NgAssetsWk : Angular Assets Workspace

Angular workspace with a library exposing scss resources, font files and images to be integrated in an Angular application.

The main goal here is to have an Angular application that doesnâ€™t require the library scss to be previously built.

The whole process is explained in this article [Adding scss assets to Angular library](https://coco-boudard.medium.com/adding-scss-assets-to-angular-library-33a9ed0654fa).

## Using the library

With the provided scripts, we can publish the library on a local Verdaccio server and use it in an Angular application.

```json
"publish:lib": "ng build @abo/ng-lib && cd dist/abo/ng-lib && npm publish --registry http://localhost:4873/",
```
